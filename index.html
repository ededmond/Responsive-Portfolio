            <p>Welcome to my homepage! The picture (hopefully to the left) was actually taken in Thailand!
                My sister taught English there for a year, and my parents and I went to visit her. It's really amazing 
                what parents will pay just so they can see both their kids on Christmas!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, this text is supposed to both take up space, and tell people about me my personality, so I figured 
                I'd let you in on a little of my thought processes while writing the previous paragraph (show don't tell,
                after all-- what if you didn't believe me!). Well, as a kid I always had trouble distinguishing between what was
                implied and what was told in English class. So, here's my question: in the above statement, I never explicitly stated
                that I had only one sibling; a sister, but it's the only logical explanation given that I said my parents wanted 
                to see 'both' their kids. Does that count as only implying that? Surprisingly, even at 23, I'm not quite sure of the answer!
            </p>
            <p>Fun fact about me: Because I have two middle names, both starting with 'M,'
             my initials <i>almost</i> spell my first name!
